# roll-the-dice
Simulate the roll of 2 dice

if the player gets a 7 or a 12 the player wins and the game ends
if the sum of both is an odd number other than 7 then the player loses and the game ends
if the sum of both is an even number other than 12 then the game continues,
the player must reroll the dice but the rules change:

- you have 5 attempts to get the number you are casting for again.
- if the dice are double, example 4 - 4, 3 - 3, etc. then the player wins an attempt.
- if the sum of the dice is 7 or 12 then lose and the game end.
